                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="main-section" id="What_you_should_already_know">
                  <header id="header">What you should already know</header>
                  <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                  <ul>
                        <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                  <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Deserunt cum, inventore deleniti vitae quam ea.</li>
                  <li>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Consectetur beatae reprehenderit sit?</li>

            <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
                  <header id="header">Hello World</header>
                  <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                  <div class="code">
                        <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                              greetMe("World");</code>
                  </div>
                  <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p> 
            </section>


            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                  <header id="header">Variables</header>  
                  <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                  <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                  <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
                  <header id="header">Declaring variables</header>
                  <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                  <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p> 
                  <div class="code">
                        <code>var x = 42.</code>
                  </div>
                  <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                  <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                  <div class="code">
                        <code>x = 42.</code>
                  </div>
                  
                  <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
                  <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                  <div class="code">
                        <code>let y = 13.</code>
                  </div>
                  
                  
                  <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
            </section>


            <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
                  <header id="header">Variable Scope</header>
                  <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
                  <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                  <div class="code">
                        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>

                  </div>
                                    <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                  <div class="code">
                        <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                              not defined</code>
                  </div>
